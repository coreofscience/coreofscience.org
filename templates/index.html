      Solutions around higher education challenges because of the COVID pandemic
    </h2>
    <p>
      The objective of this project is the training of data scientists through
      courses in datacamp and incentives in scholarships by Core of Science and
      Universidad Católica Luis Amigó. The Core of Science corporation will give
      $10,000,000 Colombian pesos in contracts to those with the best datacamp
      and GitHub performance. The data generated by these two platforms will
      allow us to understand social learning processes in a post-COVID era and
      train data scientists.

    <h2>Tree of Science</h2>
    <p>
      Tree of Science (ToS) is an integrated web-based platform for a
      comprehensive recommendation of scientific literature. Tree of Science
      shows the papers in the shape of a tree where seminal papers are in the
      roots, structural papers are in the trunk, and recent literature is in the
      leaves. Nowadays, we are working on an R package to merge Scopus and WoS
      data sets to create the Tree of Science.
